Tipple Mini Project
===================

* Brief *

We have over 40 delivery riders currently that work for us and 4-5 locations that we stock products for pick-up and delivery from.

On a busy night we have a large quantity of orders with a variation of products for an order. Delivery drivers collect multiple orders at a time to deliver, orders are packed by warehouse managers and sometimes by riders and are placed on a table in the warehouse to collect. Orders are bagged and have a delivery docket with information on what the order contains, where it needs to be delivered and any other contact details attached to the bag.

Currently these orders are being picked by the staff using a docket that our system prints out on a receipt printer. We want to digitalise & streamline this process. One of the biggest obstacles we face is as the warehouse gets real busy and under pressure, the wrong items are packed into the bag. 

We need a way for the riders to verify orders have the correct products and or a way for them to collect the correct stock.

Think of a way this can be done, if you have any questions please feel free to ask. We want you to think outside the box, we donâ€™t want you to spend days on implementing every feature you think of but if their are certain features you think of that would work well that would be out of scope we would love to hear them also. 

I have attached a few images of products, a front view of each and a picture of the barcode for each, I have also included a file containing JSON data containing the order details. Their will be a total of 3 order in the data.

Let the development begin!
